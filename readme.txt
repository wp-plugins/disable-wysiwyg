== Description ==

Disable WYSIWYG sets `user_can_richedit` to `false` that disable WYSIWYG totally completely permanently forever. This plugin also works fine with multisite enabled WordPress (aka. WordPress Mu).

WordPress:

1. Upload the extracted files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. In 'Plugins' page, choose 'Activate'

Multisite enabled WordPress:

1. Upload the extracted files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. In 'Site Admin' mode (You need log in as site admin), go to 'Plugins' page, choose 'Network Activate'
3. Just FYI, you can also activate this plugin individually for different sites.

Old-styled WordPress Mu:
